# Boston House Prices Classification and Regression Models
## Project Overview
In this project, I have built both regression and classification models using the Boston House Prices dataset. The goal of this project is to explore and predict house prices based on various features, using different machine learning techniques.

## Models Developed
### Regression Models:
1) Linear Regression
2) Random Forest Regressor
3) Gradient Boosting Regressor
4) Ridge, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net Regressions

### Classification Models:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest Classifier
4) Gradient Boosting Classifier
5) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics:
For classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
For regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²)

## Why Use Jupyter Notebook?
All the code for this project is written in Jupyter Notebook, an excellent tool for data science and machine learning projects. Jupyter Notebook is highly recommended due to its interactive environment and flexibility:

1) **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook allows you to write and execute code in an interactive format, ideal for quick experimentation and visualization.
2) **No Setup Required**: As part of popular data science distributions like Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook requires minimal setup, making it accessible for beginners and professionals alike.
3) **Code and Documentation in One Place**: You can combine code, text, and visualizations in a single notebook for an organized workflow and easy documentation.
